/**
 * Douyin RENDER_DATA reader — pure, no side effects on import.
 *
 * Task 4 of the Douyin bootstrap import plan
 * (docs/archive/plans/2026-05-06-douyin-bootstrap-import.md).
 *
 * Douyin SSR-injects a `<script id="RENDER_DATA">` element whose
 * textContent is URL-encoded JSON. Top-level key is `app`. The
 * logged-in user's sec_uid lives at one of a few canonical paths
 * inside that tree; we try each in order and return the first hit.
 *
 * Verified empirically via chrome-devtools MCP probe 2026-05-07
 * (anonymous /jingxuan landing page returned a 181 KB payload with
 * top key `app`). The exact sub-path varies between login states
 * and Douyin React-app versions, so we accept multiple shapes.
